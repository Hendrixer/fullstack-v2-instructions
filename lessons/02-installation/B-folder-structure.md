## app

All of our pages will go here. Using the app directory instead of the pages directory means we're opting into server / client components architecture.

## assets

Nice place to put all and any images we might have.

## components

Any and all components that aren't pages.

## lib

Non component, utility code used all over the app. Things like hashing passwords, checkint JWT tokens, fetching data from the API.

## pages

Our API routes will live in `/pages/api`. API have yet to be migrated from the pages directory.

## styles

All our styles
